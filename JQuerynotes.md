### Start up writing jquery

$(document).ready(function(){});

- Putting document between the parentheses refers to the HTML document itself.
- .ready(); is a function, or basic action, in jQuery. Whatever goes in .ready()'s parentheses is the jQuery event that occurs as soon as the HTML document is ready.
- Functions are the basic unit of doing work in jQuery.
